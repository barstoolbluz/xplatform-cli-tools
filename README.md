## Overview

This environment integrates with 1Password to create a more secure pattern for managing credentials in cross-platform workflows. Instead of storing credentials in unencrypted files on disk, it fetches them at runtime and keeps them only for the duration of the command.

**Built-in CLI Tools:**
- Git (`git`)
- GitHub CLI (`gh`)
- AWS CLI (`aws`)
- Additional packages (see [Installed Packages](#installed-packages))

The environment's manifest defines all tools declaratively in TOML format ([see About Flox](#about-flox)), and they install automatically when you activate the environment‚Äîno manual installation needed. Shell function wrappers intercept calls to these tools and handle credentials securely. You can easily extend this pattern to include other CLI tools ([see Extensibility](#extensibility)).

**Compatible systems:**
- Apple Silicon Macs (aarch64-darwin)
- Intel Macs (x86_64-darwin)
- Linux ARM (aarch64-linux)
- Linux x86 (x86_64-linux)

## Security Benefits ‚úÖ

Many popular CLI tools store credentials in unencrypted files:
- GitHub CLI stores tokens in `~/.config/gh/hosts.yml`;
- AWS CLI stores credentials in `~/.aws/credentials`;
- Git does not cache credentials by default, but some configurations store credentials in plaintext.

This environment mitigates these attack vectors by:
1. Fetching credentials from 1Password at runtime
2. Injecting them via environment variables in ephemeral subshells
3. Ensuring credentials exist only for the duration of the command
4. Preventing unencrypted credentials from persisting on disk

## How It Works

The environment's wrapper functions for `git`, `gh`, and `aws`:

1. Extract credentials from 1Password at runtime;
2. Pass these credentials securely to the underlying commands;
3. Clean up any temporary files after execution.

### Authentication Methods

The environment uses two approaches for credential handling:

#### `op run` (for `gh` and `aws`)
- Executes commands in an ephemeral subshell;
- Retrieves secrets directly from 1Password and exports them as environment variables;
- Keeps credentials only within the subshell and destroys them when the command finishes.

#### `op read` (for `git`)
- Reads the token directly from 1Password;
- Creates a temporary script (via `GIT_ASKPASS`) that outputs the token when Git requests it;
- Uses trap-based cleanup mechanisms to remove temporary files.

### Environment-Aware Authentication Flow

The environment adapts its authentication method based on context:

- [Local Development](#local-development-setup) - Uses interactive authentication with persistent session tokens;
- [CI/CD](#cicd-integration) - Uses non-interactive authentication with service accounts.

## Quick Start

1. [Install the Flox CLI](#installation)
2. [Set up 1Password CLI](#1password-cli-setup-local-development)
3. [Configure your 1Password vault structure](#1password-vault-configuration)
4. Activate the environment with `flox activate`
5. Use `git`, `gh`, and `aws` commands normally - credential management happens automatically

## 1Password Vault Configuration

### Local Development Setup

You'll need to customize environment variables to match your 1Password vault structure:

```toml
[vars]
# 1Password GitHub config
OP_GITHUB_VAULT = "vault"                  # Name of 1Password vault containing GitHub tokens
OP_GITHUB_TOKEN_ITEM = "token_item"        # Name of the item storing GitHub token
OP_GITHUB_TOKEN_FIELD = "token_field"      # Field name containing the GitHub token

# 1Password AWS config
OP_AWS_VAULT = "vault"                     # Name of 1Password vault containing AWS credentials
OP_AWS_CREDENTIALS_ITEM = "aws_creds"      # Name of the item storing AWS credentials
OP_AWS_USERNAME_FIELD = "username"         # Field name for AWS access key ID
OP_AWS_CREDENTIALS_FIELD = "credentials"   # Field name for AWS secret access key
```

**Important:** Modify these environment variables in your `manifest.toml` to match your own 1Password vault structure.

## Usage üõ†Ô∏è

### Activate the Environment
```sh
flox activate
```

Once activated, use the wrapped commands normally:

### GitHub CLI (gh)
```sh
# Check auth status
gh auth status

# List repositories
gh repo list

# Clone a repository
gh repo clone org/repo
```

### Git
```sh
# Push to a repository (auth handled automatically)
git push origin main

# Pull from a repository
git pull

# Clone a private repository
git clone https://github.com/organization/private-repo.git
```

### AWS CLI
```sh
# List S3 buckets
aws s3 ls

# Describe EC2 instances
aws ec2 describe-instances
```

### Non-Interactive Shells ‚ö†Ô∏è

For scripts, source the wrapper file before using the commands:

```sh
# Bash scripts
source "$FLOX_ENV_CACHE/shell/wrapper.bash"
git push origin main

# Zsh scripts
source "$FLOX_ENV_CACHE/shell/wrapper.zsh"
gh repo list

# Fish scripts
source "$FLOX_ENV_CACHE/shell/wrapper.fish"
aws s3 ls
```

## CI/CD Integration

For CI/CD environments:

1. **Create a 1Password Service Account**:
   - Follow [1Password's documentation](https://developer.1password.com/docs/service-accounts) to create a service account
   - Generate a service account token with appropriate access to your vaults

2. **Configure GitHub Actions**:
   - Add the service account token as a secret in your GitHub repository:
     ```
     OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN=your-service-account-token
     ```

3. **GitHub Actions Workflow Example**:
   ```yaml
   name: CI with 1Password Integration
   
   on:
     push:
       branches: [ main ]
   
   jobs:
     build:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       
       steps:
       - uses: actions/checkout@v3
       
       - name: Set up Flox
         uses: flox-examples/setup-flox@v1
       
       - name: Activate environment with credentials
         env:
           OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN }}
         run: flox activate
       
       # Your other steps that use the secure credentials
   ```

When running in GitHub Actions, the environment automatically detects the CI platform and uses the service account token for non-interactive authentication.

## Shell Compatibility

The environment supports three shells, each with its own wrapper script:

- **Bash** ‚Äì `wrapper.bash`
- **Zsh** ‚Äì `wrapper.zsh`
- **Fish** ‚Äì `wrapper.fish`

Each wrapper implements shell-specific trap-based cleanup mechanisms.

## Extensibility

You can extend this environment in two key dimensions:

### Extending to Other CLI Tools

You can apply this pattern to many other CLI tools that require credentials:

- Databricks CLI
- Snowflake CLI
- Azure CLI
- Google Cloud Platform SDK
- Terraform CLI
- OpenStack CLI

#### How to Extend CLI Tools

To support a new tool:

1. **Add environment variables** to your `manifest.toml`:

```toml
[vars]
# Existing vars
OP_GITHUB_VAULT = "vault"
# ...

# New vars for your tool (e.g., Databricks)
OP_DATABRICKS_VAULT = "vault"              # Vault containing Databricks credentials
OP_DATABRICKS_ITEM = "databricks_creds"    # Item storing Databricks credentials
OP_DATABRICKS_HOST_FIELD = "host"          # Field for Databricks host
OP_DATABRICKS_TOKEN_FIELD = "token"        # Field for Databricks token
```

2. **Write a wrapper function** in the `on-activate` hook:

```bash
# Example for Databricks CLI
databricks() { 
  op run --session "$OP_SESSION_TOKEN" --env-file <(echo -e "DATABRICKS_HOST=op://$OP_DATABRICKS_VAULT/$OP_DATABRICKS_ITEM/$OP_DATABRICKS_HOST_FIELD\nDATABRICKS_TOKEN=op://$OP_DATABRICKS_VAULT/$OP_DATABRICKS_ITEM/$OP_DATABRICKS_TOKEN_FIELD") -- databricks "$@"; 
}
```

3. **Add environment detection** to your wrapper function

### Extending to Other CI Environments

The environment already includes a modular `detect_environment()` function that can be extended to support additional CI platforms:

```bash
detect_environment() {
  # GitHub Actions detection
  if [[ -n "$GITHUB_ACTIONS" ]]; then
    echo "github_actions"
    return 0
  fi
  
  # Add detection for other CI platforms here if needed:
  # Example:
  # if [[ -n "$CIRCLECI" ]]; then
  #   echo "circle_ci"
  #   return 0
  # fi
  
  # No CI detected - we're local
  echo "local"
  return 0
}
```

#### How to Extend to Other CI Platforms

1. **Identify the environment variable** that uniquely identifies your CI platform:
   - CircleCI: `$CIRCLECI`
   - GitLab CI: `$GITLAB_CI`
   - Jenkins: `$JENKINS_URL`
   - Travis CI: `$TRAVIS`
   - Azure DevOps: `$TF_BUILD`
   - Buildkite: `$BUILDKITE`

2. **Modify the `detect_environment()` function** to recognize the new platform:

```bash
detect_environment() {
  # GitHub Actions detection
  if [[ -n "$GITHUB_ACTIONS" ]]; then
    echo "github_actions"
    return 0
  fi
  
  # CircleCI detection
  if [[ -n "$CIRCLECI" ]]; then
    echo "circle_ci"
    return 0
  fi
  
  # GitLab CI detection
  if [[ -n "$GITLAB_CI" ]]; then
    echo "gitlab_ci"
    return 0
  fi
  
  # Jenkins detection
  if [[ -n "$JENKINS_URL" ]]; then
    echo "jenkins"
    return 0
  fi
  
  # No CI detected - we're local
  echo "local"
  return 0
}
```

3. **Customize the authentication logic** for your CI platform if needed:

```bash
authenticate_1password() {
  SESSION_FILE="$HOME/.config/op/1password-session.token"
  
  # Check if we already have a valid session (file-based for local, env var for CI)
  local env=$(detect_environment)
  
  if [[ "$env" == "local" ]]; then
    # Local environment authentication logic...
  elif [[ "$env" == "github_actions" ]]; then
    # GitHub Actions authentication logic...
  elif [[ "$env" == "circle_ci" ]]; then
    # CircleCI-specific authentication logic
    echo "CircleCI environment detected"
    
    if [[ -z "$OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN" ]]; then
      echo "Error: OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN is not set. Required for CircleCI authentication."
      return 1
    fi
    
    # CircleCI may have specific requirements or optimizations
    echo "Authenticating with 1Password service account for CircleCI..."
    if OP_SESSION_TOKEN=$(op signin --raw --service-account-token "$OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN" 2>/dev/null); then
      export OP_SESSION_TOKEN
      echo "Successfully authenticated with 1Password service account"
      return 0
    else
      echo "Failed to authenticate with 1Password service account"
      return 1
    fi
  elif [[ "$env" == "gitlab_ci" ]]; then
    # GitLab CI-specific authentication logic
    # ...
  fi
}
```

4. **Create CI platform-specific configuration** for your workflows:

**CircleCI:**
```yaml
version: 2.1
jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/base:current
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run:
          name: Install Flox
          command: curl https://get.flox.dev/install | bash
      - run:
          name: Activate environment
          command: |
            export PATH="$HOME/.flox/bin:$PATH"
            export OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN=$OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN
            flox activate
      # Your other steps that use the secure credentials
```

**GitLab CI:**
```yaml
stages:
  - build

build:
  stage: build
  image: ubuntu:latest
  before_script:
    - apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl
    - curl https://get.flox.dev/install | bash
    - export PATH="$HOME/.flox/bin:$PATH"
  script:
    - export OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN=$OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN
    - flox activate
    # Your other steps that use the secure credentials
  variables:
    OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN: ${OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN}
```

By extending environment detection and auth logic this way, you get (more) secure credential management that works across virtually any CI/CD platform.

## Prerequisites

### 1Password CLI Setup (Local Development)

This environment expects the 1Password CLI to be configured. You can set it up in two ways:

#### Option 1: Automatic Setup

```sh
flox activate -r barstoolbluz/setup-1pass
```

This wizard will guide you through creating the necessary configuration.

#### Option 2: Manual Setup

Create the config file at `~/.config/op/config` with your 1Password account information:

```json
{
        "latest_signin": "your_organization",
        "device": "2xdzachbrog69jockvku6qshakeyerhips",
        "accounts": [
                {
                        "shorthand": "your_org_shorthand",
                        "accountUUID": "H4D9BhyE9WmS7-MbaG0qWDsaOi",
                        "url": "https://your-team.1password.com",
                        "email": "your.email@example.com",
                        "accountKey": "Y6bXKI-Z6_9ONAkwYRbFnQRcn3lyIEY4DDpgkURh",
                        "userUUID": "GR9EqmcQVmIGa6XCIpW8hue6Ef"
                }
        ]
}
```

## Installation

The only required dependency is the [Flox CLI](https://flox.dev/docs/).

To install:

1. Visit the Flox [download page](https://flox.dev/get)

2. Download the appropriate package for your system:
   - Linux (Intel/x86_64): Choose either `.deb` or `.rpm` package
   - Linux (ARM): Choose either `.deb` or `.rpm` package
   - macOS (Intel): Download the `.pkg` installer
   - macOS (ARM/Apple Silicon): Download the `.pkg` installer

3. Follow your OS's standard installation procedure

## Notes

### Session Token Handling

#### Local Environment
The environment caches 1Password session tokens under:

```sh
$HOME/.config/op/1password-session.token
```

#### CI Environment
In CI environments, session tokens are kept exclusively in memory as environment variables.

**Security considerations:**

- **Convenience vs. Security**: Caching tokens offers convenience but introduces potential vulnerabilities
- **Time-limited**: Session tokens expire after inactivity (typically 30 minutes)
- **Local storage only**: File permissions (chmod 600) protect tokens in local environments
- **CI security**: Tokens remain only in memory in CI environments, never written to disk

This approach balances security and usability. Consider avoiding token caching entirely for high-security environments.

### Installed Packages

This environment includes:

- **1Password CLI** (`op`): For secure credential management

## About Flox

[Flox](https://flox.dev) combines package and environment management, building on [Nix](https://github.com/NixOS/nix). It gives you the benefits of Nix but with a friendly, intuitive UX:

- **Declarative environments**. Software packages, variables, services, etc. are defined in simple, human-readable TOML format;
- **Content-addressed storage**. Multiple versions of packages with conflicting dependencies can coexist in the same environment;
- **Reproducibility**. The same environment can be reused across development, CI, and production;
- **Deterministic builds**. The same inputs always produce identical outputs for a given architecture, regardless of when or where builds occur;
- **World's largest collection of packages**. Access to over 150,000 packages‚Äîand millions of package-version combinations‚Äîfrom [Nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs).
