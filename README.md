## Overview

This environment implements a more secure pattern for managing credentials in cross-platform workflows by integrating with 1Password. Rather than storing credentials in unencrypted files on disk, it fetches them at runtime and keeps them only for the duration of the command.

**Built-in CLI Tools:**
- Git (`git`)
- GitHub CLI (`gh`)
- AWS CLI (`aws`)
- Additional packages (see [Installed Packages](#installed-packages))

All tools are declaratively defined in TOML in the environment's manifest ([see About Flox](#about-flox)) and are automatically installed when you activate the environment‚Äîno manual installation needed. The environment uses shell function wrappers to intercept calls to these tools and handle credentials securely. Its design is such that you can easily extend this pattern to include other CLI tools ([see Extensibility](#extensibility)).

**Compatible systems:**
- Apple Silicon Macs (aarch64-darwin)
- Intel Macs (x86_64-darwin)
- Linux ARM (aarch64-linux)
- Linux x86 (x86_64-linux)

## Security Benefits ‚úÖ

Many popular CLI tools store credentials in unencrypted files:
- GitHub CLI stores tokens in `~/.config/gh/hosts.yml`;
- AWS CLI stores credentials in `~/.aws/credentials`;
- Git does not cache credentials by default, but some configurations store credentials in plaintext.

This environment is designed to mitigate these attack vectors by:
1. Fetching credentials from 1Password at runtime;
2. Injecting them via environment variables in ephemeral subshells;
3. Ensuring credentials exist only for the duration of the command;
4. Preventing unencrypted credentials from persisting on disk.

## How It Works

The environment implements wrapper functions for `git`, `gh`, and `aws` that:

1. Extract credentials from 1Password at runtime;
2. Pass these credentials to the underlying commands securely;
3. Clean up any temporary files after execution.

### Authentication Methods

Two approaches are used for credential handling:

#### `op run` (for `gh` and `aws`)
- Executes commands in an ephemeral subshell;
- Retrieves secrets directly from 1Password and exports them as environment variables;
- Credentials exist only within the subshell and are destroyed when the command finishes.

#### `op read` (for `git`)
- Directly reads the token from 1Password;
- Creates a temporary script (via `GIT_ASKPASS`) that outputs the token when Git requests it;
- Uses trap-based cleanup mechanisms to remove temporary files.

### Environment-Aware Authentication Flow

The environment adapts its authentication method based on context:

- [Local Development](#local-development-setup) - Interactive authentication with persistent session tokens;
- [CI/CD](#cicd-integration) - Non-interactive authentication using service accounts.

## Quick Start

1. [Install the Flox CLI](#installation)
2. [Set up 1Password CLI](#1password-cli-setup-local-development)
3. [Configure your 1Password vault structure](#1password-vault-configuration)
4. Activate the environment with `flox activate`
5. Use `git`, `gh`, and `aws` commands normally - credential management happens automatically

## 1Password Vault Configuration

### Local Development Setup

You'll need to customize environment variables to match your 1Password vault structure:

```toml
[vars]
# 1Password GitHub config
OP_GITHUB_VAULT = "vault"                  # Name of 1Password vault containing GitHub tokens
OP_GITHUB_TOKEN_ITEM = "token_item"        # Name of the item storing GitHub token
OP_GITHUB_TOKEN_FIELD = "token_field"      # Field name containing the GitHub token

# 1Password AWS config
OP_AWS_VAULT = "vault"                     # Name of 1Password vault containing AWS credentials
OP_AWS_CREDENTIALS_ITEM = "aws_creds"      # Name of the item storing AWS credentials
OP_AWS_USERNAME_FIELD = "username"         # Field name for AWS access key ID
OP_AWS_CREDENTIALS_FIELD = "credentials"   # Field name for AWS secret access key
```

**Important:** You must modify these environment variables in your `manifest.toml` to match your own 1Password vault structure.

## Usage üõ†Ô∏è

### Activate the Environment
```sh
flox activate
```

Once activated, use the wrapped commands normally:

### GitHub CLI (gh)
```sh
# Check auth status
gh auth status

# List repositories
gh repo list

# Clone a repository
gh repo clone org/repo
```

### Git
```sh
# Push to a repository (auth handled automatically)
git push origin main

# Pull from a repository
git pull

# Clone a private repository
git clone https://github.com/organization/private-repo.git
```

### AWS CLI
```sh
# List S3 buckets
aws s3 ls

# Describe EC2 instances
aws ec2 describe-instances
```

### Non-Interactive Shells ‚ö†Ô∏è

For scripts, source the wrapper file before using the commands:

```sh
# Bash scripts
source "$FLOX_ENV_CACHE/shell/wrapper.bash"
git push origin main

# Zsh scripts
source "$FLOX_ENV_CACHE/shell/wrapper.zsh"
gh repo list

# Fish scripts
source "$FLOX_ENV_CACHE/shell/wrapper.fish"
aws s3 ls
```

## CI/CD Integration

For CI/CD environments:

1. **Create a 1Password Service Account**:
   - Follow [1Password's documentation](https://developer.1password.com/docs/service-accounts) to create a service account
   - Generate a service account token with appropriate access to your vaults

2. **Configure GitHub Actions**:
   - Add the service account token as a secret in your GitHub repository:
     ```
     OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN=your-service-account-token
     ```

3. **GitHub Actions Workflow Example**:
   ```yaml
   name: CI with 1Password Integration
   
   on:
     push:
       branches: [ main ]
   
   jobs:
     build:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       
       steps:
       - uses: actions/checkout@v3
       
       - name: Set up Flox
         uses: flox-examples/setup-flox@v1
       
       - name: Activate environment with credentials
         env:
           OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN }}
         run: flox activate
       
       # Your other steps that use the secure credentials
   ```

The environment will automatically detect that it's running in GitHub Actions and use the service account token for non-interactive authentication.

## Shell Compatibility

The environment supports three shells, each with its own wrapper script:

- **Bash** ‚Äì `wrapper.bash`
- **Zsh** ‚Äì `wrapper.zsh`
- **Fish** ‚Äì `wrapper.fish`

Each wrapper implements proper trap-based cleanup mechanisms specific to its environment.

## Extensibility

This pattern can be extended to other CLI tools that require credentials:

- Databricks CLI
- Snowflake CLI
- Azure CLI
- Google Cloud Platform SDK
- Terraform CLI
- OpenStack CLI

### How to Extend

To add support for another tool:

1. **Define environment variables** in your `manifest.toml`:

```toml
[vars]
# Existing vars
OP_GITHUB_VAULT = "vault"
# ...

# New vars for your tool (e.g., Databricks)
OP_DATABRICKS_VAULT = "vault"              # Vault containing Databricks credentials
OP_DATABRICKS_ITEM = "databricks_creds"    # Item storing Databricks credentials
OP_DATABRICKS_HOST_FIELD = "host"          # Field for Databricks host
OP_DATABRICKS_TOKEN_FIELD = "token"        # Field for Databricks token
```

2. **Create a wrapper function** in the `on-activate` hook:

```bash
# Example for Databricks CLI
databricks() { 
  op run --session "$OP_SESSION_TOKEN" --env-file <(echo -e "DATABRICKS_HOST=op://$OP_DATABRICKS_VAULT/$OP_DATABRICKS_ITEM/$OP_DATABRICKS_HOST_FIELD\nDATABRICKS_TOKEN=op://$OP_DATABRICKS_VAULT/$OP_DATABRICKS_ITEM/$OP_DATABRICKS_TOKEN_FIELD") -- databricks "$@"; 
}
```

3. **Make your wrapper environment-aware** with proper environment detection:

```bash
# Additional code to handle CI vs local environments
```

## About Flox

## Prerequisites

### 1Password CLI Setup (Local Development)

This environment expects the 1Password CLI to be configured. You can set it up in two ways:

#### Option 1: Automatic Setup

```sh
flox activate -r barstoolbluz/setup-1pass
```

This wizard will guide you through creating the necessary configuration.

#### Option 2: Manual Setup

Create the config file at `~/.config/op/config` with your 1Password account information:

```json
{
        "latest_signin": "your_organization",
        "device": "2xdzachbrog69jockvku6qshakeyerhips",
        "accounts": [
                {
                        "shorthand": "your_org_shorthand",
                        "accountUUID": "H4D9BhyE9WmS7-MbaG0qWDsaOi",
                        "url": "https://your-team.1password.com",
                        "email": "your.email@example.com",
                        "accountKey": "Y6bXKI-Z6_9ONAkwYRbFnQRcn3lyIEY4DDpgkURh",
                        "userUUID": "GR9EqmcQVmIGa6XCIpW8hue6Ef"
                }
        ]
}
```

## Installation

The only required dependency is the [Flox CLI](https://flox.dev/docs/).

To install:

1. Visit the Flox [download page](https://flox.dev/get)

2. Download the appropriate package for your system:
   - Linux (Intel/x86_64): Choose either `.deb` or `.rpm` package
   - Linux (ARM): Choose either `.deb` or `.rpm` package
   - macOS (Intel): Download the `.pkg` installer
   - macOS (ARM/Apple Silicon): Download the `.pkg` installer

3. Follow your OS's standard installation procedure

## Notes

### Session Token Handling

#### Local Environment
The environment caches 1Password session tokens under:

```sh
$HOME/.config/op/1password-session.token
```

#### CI Environment
In CI environments, session tokens are kept exclusively in memory as environment variables.

**Security considerations:**

- **Convenience vs. Security**: Caching provides convenience but creates a potential vulnerability
- **Time-limited**: Session tokens expire after a period of inactivity (typically 30 minutes)
- **Local storage only**: In local environments, tokens are protected with file permissions (chmod 600)
- **CI security**: In CI environments, tokens remain in memory only and are never written to disk

This approach balances security and usability. For higher security environments, you may want to avoid caching the token.
